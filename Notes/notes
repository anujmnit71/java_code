1) use while an if cautiously , in a recursive function if is used 
  whereas , in iterative function while is used 
  
2)increment rank of only one while combining equal rank sets

3)see efficient v/s in efficient implementation 

4)in LCAin tree code give incorrect and in case one of the value is not present in tree
